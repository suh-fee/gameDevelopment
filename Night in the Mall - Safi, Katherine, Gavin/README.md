A three player asymetrical stealth board game done for NYU's Intro to Game Design course using a lasercut wood board, a partition to seperate two players, and a totally random unique experience each time.

Included are all the files needed to play the game, including the board layout, rules, and all artwork.

Images are also included of the game being played in person.

I was responsible for the board creation and cutting, overall game design, rules iteration, item sets, and small portions of the board design.
